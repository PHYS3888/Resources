### History of art paintings through the lens of entropy and complexity (2018)

> Our research shows that simple physics-inspired metrics that are estimated from local spatial ordering patterns in paintings encode crucial information about the artwork. We present numerical scales that map well to canonical concepts in art history and reveal a historical and measurable evolutionary trend in visual arts. They also allow us to distinguish different artistic styles and artworks based on the degree of local order in the paintings.

### Spreading of memes through physics literature (2014)

Can you automatically find new ideas in physics that propagate across different scientific papers?

> "The 50 terms from the APS archive with the highest propagation scores included many plausible meme candidates, such as “loop quantum cosmology” (#1) and “carbon nanotubes” (#6), as well as several chemical formulas, including MgB2 (#7; a well-known superconductor)."

### On the growth and form of cortical convolutions (2016)

> "We use magnetic resonance images to build a 3D-printed layered gel mimic of the developing smooth fetal brain; when immersed in a solvent, the outer layer swells relative to the core, mimicking cortical growth."

### Identification of influential spreaders in complex networks (2010)

> "the most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis"

> "when multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously the distance between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extent of the spreading"

# Extra options (more challenging)

### New evidence for brain criticality (2019)

Do the brain's dynamics and function exploit criticality?

> In experiments, they find that rat brains go through a critical point as the brains switch between states with different kinds of neuronal behavior. The team’s results could help narrow down the mechanisms underpinning the brain’s critical point.

### A phase transition in language learning (2019)

How do children learn the complex structure of language?

> "Physicist Eric DeGiuli of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris proposes that CFGs can be treated as if they are physical objects, with a “surface” consisting of all possible arrangements of words into sentences, including, in principle, nonsensical ones. His idea is that children instinctively deduce the “deep” grammar rules as they are exposed to the tree’s “surface” (sentences they hear). Learning the rules that allow some sentences but not others, he says, amounts to the child assigning weights to the branches and constantly adjusting these weights in response to the language she hears. Eventually, the branches leading to ungrammatical sentences acquire very small weights, and those sentences are recognized as improbable. These many word configurations, DeGiuli says, are like the microstates in statistical mechanics—the set of all possible arrangements of a system’s constituent particles."

### Spatial evolution of human dialects (2017)

Language boundaries are driven by surface tension.
An example of using physical ideas to understand how human dialects are distributed through space.

> "Boundaries of language dialect regions are controlled by a length minimizing effect analogous to surface tension, mediated by variations in population density which can induce curvature, and by the shape of coastline or similar borders"

### Stretching an elastic loop (2016)

> "Loop tightening leads to one of three outcomes: a crease, a pop-out, or a twist. The final shape is a competition between bending and stretching forces."

### Brain motion under impact (2018)

> We showed that the brain’s deformation is most sensitive in low frequency regimes close to 30 Hz, and discovered that for most subconcussive head impacts, the dynamics of brain deformation is dominated by a few low-frequency, damped modes of vibration in brain tissue. This finding could inform the design of sports helmets.

### Physics of spreading disease processes in the brain (2018)

Computer simulations of the diffusion and aggregation of harmful proteins in the brain reproduce the pattern of damage seen in neurodegenerative diseases.

> The harmful proteins are known to travel preferentially through the network of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, rather than through the fluid outside of cells.
